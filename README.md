# Code-Review-Toolkit
This is the repository for the Thematic Project unit of my Cyber Security course. This repository is a toolkit with articles and tools to help developers make their code more secure.

## How To Use
We advise each developer to first read the general best practices before reading the articles relating to their programming language of choice; this is due to the fact that this advice relates to every developer and can be a precursor to understanding the more specific articles.
Developers are also encouraged to read about the automated vulnerability scanning tools as they will help automate finding vulnerabilities in your code, improving every developer's productivity and security.

### Coming in the future
_Vulnerability Scanner_; Our team is planning to implement our own static application security testing (SAST) tool, combining the best features of the security scanners we have researched. This tool would be fully open source to allow customisability and to facilitate transparency.

_Capture-The-Flag (CTF)_; we plan to implement our own CTF-style game to promote learning and to help developers develop pattern recognition when looking for vulnerabilties. This allows developers to learn security in a fun and memorable way.
